						<h3 id="sec21" class="section-title">Overview</h3>
						<div class="section-content">
							<p>
								Things to keep in mind : It won't work unless you follow this documentation fully, i.e to configure it. So before you head to check out how the skin looks on your VA, make sure you've done all the required work. For your sake and mine :)
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3 id="chekclist" class="section-title">Installation Checklist</h3>
						<div class="section-content">

							<ol>
									<li>Make sure you have the latest stable phpVMS, Version v5.5.2+ </li>
									<li>Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of iCrew LITE</li>
									<li>If you already use Mark Swan's CrewCenter, you can skip to Item #9</li>
									<li>Create a new sub domain, go to your <strong>cpanel > Domains > Add Sub Domain</strong> and create a new subomain. Examples : "crew.yoursite.com", "waterside.bavirtual.com", "icrew.delta-virtual.com". <em>Geddit ?</em> </li>
									<li>Go to your local.config.php and take a note of your database details and also, Take a backup of your entire database. (Just in case, and this can by done via cPanel too)</li>
									<li>Upload the latest version of phpVMS (which is phpVMS 5.5.2) on that subdomain's folder via your filemanager or FTP</li>
									<li>Now open that subdomain and run the <b>update.php</b> provided with the phpVMS</li>
									<li>Fill in the necessary details like the URL etc, the part where it asks about your Database details, put the stuff you copied earlier from your local.config.php (Item #5) and install normally. </li>
									<li>Now, you have phpVMS successfully running on a subdomain with all of your existing data from previous database. Check for all crucial details like your Pilots, Schedules, PIREPS, Total VA Hours etc.</li>
									<li>Unzip the iCrew LITE package and paste it into public_html/(subdomain_folder_name)/lib/skins</li>
									<li>Go to your admin panel and change the skin to iCrew LITE</li>
							</ol>
							<!-- <a href="./install.php" class="button">Open Installer</a><br><br> -->
							<p>
									Your Crew center is successfully installed, but not yet configured. So it would either keep loading with the preloader or show some error. Don't panic, just continue with the configuration.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="space"></div>

						<h3 id="config" class="section-title">Configuration</h3>
						<div class="section-content">
							Configuring iCrew LITE is very easy, I've tried my best to do it all from one place.<br><br>
							Go to <strong>sub_domain_folder > core > local.config.php </strong> and add these lines above <code># Page encoding options</code> <br><br>
							<code>
								/*iCrew LITE Configuration lines */<br>
								define('CREWCENTER_TITLE', 'Demo<strong>Crew</strong>'); <br>
								define('VA_TAGLINE', 'jetairwaysvirtual'); <br>
								define('GMAPS_API', 'asIlxuYoUrGooGlEMaPskEyGoeSherexsur');
							</code><br><br>

							> Now, in the place of DemoCrew you can put in a suitable name for your VA, like BluCrew, iCrew, DeltaCrew, RedCrew etc.
							If nothing is desirable, then use your VA's name itself. <br>
							> Now, for your the VA Tagline, use your "real world airline's tagline", for example for American Airlines, it would be "GoingForGreat". Keep in mind this will be preceeded with a '#' <br>
							> In the GMAPS_API, paste your Google maps API Key. If you don't know how to acquire one, click <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>
						</div>

						<div class="space"></div>

						<h3 id="reqadd" class="section-title">Required Addons</h3>
						<div class="section-content">
							<p>
								iCrew LITE requires certain modules to be installed in order to work perfectly. Such modules include <br>
								<ol>
									<li> AIR Mail - simpilotgroup </li>
									<li> Pop Up News - simpilotgroup </li>
									<li> Credits - simpilotgroup </li>
									<li> Events - simpilotgroup</li>
									<li> Ranks - iCrewSystems </li>
									<li> Privacy - iCrewSystems </li>
								</ol>

								To make your work short and to save time, I'd fully recommend to use the <a href="https://github.com/DavidJClark/phpVMS-Plugins_Manager">Plugin Manager </a> (except Ranks module, everything is included there)<br>
								You can find the Ranks & Privacy module along with the downloads, just place them in core > modules and you're done. For all these addons, the template files are already included with the Skin, so you pretty much have nothing to do but to install it ;)

						<h2 class="section-head">How things work <span class="text-danger"> VERY IMPORTANT</h2>
						<div class="section-content">
							<p>
								[UPDATE] : I have found through the phpVMS Forum post that most of the issues are because the admins forgot to do this part. I repeat, donot skip this part, it's quite important.<br><br>
								Well, mostly I've made sure everything is dynamic, which means you don't have to change / monitor anything, but there are few stuff which you need to tweak in order to make sure everything works perfectly.
								<br> To begin with, the Staff Page needs a little configuration to do. It's simple, you just need to understand this over here! The skin is even already exported with the code, so no need to Copy paste too.<br><br>
									<br>To the guys who are from 'Non Computer Science background', and the guys who donot understand what is an array, An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
									So we are storing all the staff positions and the name of the respective staff inside "$staff_array". This is called as an Associative Array <br>
									You will need to edit these lines which are located at <strong>lib > skins > iCrewLITE > staff.php > on line 13</strong>
									<br><br>Layout : First Part = 'Name of the staff position', Second Part = 'Name of the person'
									<br><br>
								<pre><code>$staff_array = array(<br><br>"COO"=>"Gabriel Iglesias", <br>"Flight Operations"=>"D.J Trump"<br><br>);</code></pre>
									<br><br>

								Next, open <strong>core > common > StatsData.class.php </strong> and after line '556' add the following <br><br>
								<pre><code>public static function TodayHours() { <br>return self::getTotalForCol(array('table' => 'pireps','column' => '*',<br>'where' => array('DATE(`submitdate`) = CURDATE()'),'func' => 'SUM'));<br> }</code>
						</pre>
						<br>
						<strong><h3>The Focus Airports</h3> </strong>
						<br>
						Now this is something which one of my friends recommended me to add. The module is extremely simple, no complex code at all. Which makes it almost a 'manual' module. <br>
						When you want to add a new Focus Airport, simply go the <strong>focusairport</strong> folder in <Strong>lib > skins > iCrewLITE </strong> and change the 'ICAO Code' and the 'Image'. As default, I've added 'OMDB' to be the Focus Airport.<br>
						Here's a Tip, (this is completely my opinion) use pictures which have tags like '#silhouette, #sunset' of famous monuments of the Airport's City. For example, i came up with this picture when I searched for 'Dubai skyline sunset silhouette'.

						<br><br>
						<strong><h3>The Ranks Module</h3> </strong>
						<br>
							That's pretty simple, you can find the required files at the folder called 'Modules' with this installer. Paste that folder under your core > modules and it's done. Please note that it will NOT work as intended if you donot have pictures which depict your VA's respective rankings.
						</div>

						<strong><h3 id="cuz">Cuztomization</h3> </strong>
						<br>
							As default, the Crew Center comes with the 'Indigo' theme color, however you have 16+ Theme colors to choose from. The list of the colors are given below, <br>
							<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iCrewSystems/iCrewLITE/master/Documentation/assets/img/colors.PNG" height="450" width="auto" />
							To change your theme, just simply go to <strong> lib > skins > iCrewLITE > layout.php </strong> and on line '79' <code>theme-indigo</code> change the "indigo" to your desired theme.<br><br>

							For your login background screen, for this release, you have to change it in each of the login_xyz.php and registration_xyz.php in the <code>style</code> tag.

					<div id="zzs" class="section">
						<h2 class="section-head">Known Issues and how to fix them</h2>
						<div class="section-content">
							<p>
								<ol>
									<li>Once you logout of the CrewCenter, you see a weird blue page with your VA's news feed. <br><br>
										FIX : Go to core > modules > Logout > Logout.php and in line 25 you should have "header('Location: '.url('/'));"
										Change it to the link you want to direc﻿t to, for example
										<br>
										To redirect the page to a module within the VA after logging out : "header('Location: '.url('/'));"
										<br>
										To redirect the page to a URL outside the VA : "header('Location: https://www.myvahomepage.com');"
									</li>
									<br><br>
									<li>
										Recaptcha says invalid, users unable to register. <br><br>
										FIX : Get your reCaptcha public & private keys and update it at core > codon.config.php. Just do a Ctrl + F and "captcha", paste the keys accordingly.
									</li>
								</ol>

					<h2 class="section-head">Congratulations</h2>
					<div class="section-content">
						<p>
								Congratulations, you've successfully installed iCrew LITE Crew Center to your Virtual Airline. I am not sure, but there might be some little fine tuning work left for you. I am sure you can handle that ;) If you think something is wrong, don't hesitate to trouble me.

I also wish to thank Ms. Rashi Trivedi for motivating me to continue this project. Finally, I'd like to thank God for providing the wisdom, knowledge and understanding to complete this project.
								<br><br>
								Do you wish for me to add something? Wish for me to add styling to your existing modules? I can do that! Write up an email / open a forum post / DM on the phpVMS Forum
